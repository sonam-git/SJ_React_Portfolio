# Overview

## The Challenge
The primary goal of this project is to develop a single-page application portfolio that highlights the expertise and capabilities of a web developer in constructing React applications. The key objectives for this project include:

1. Developing an interface that is dynamic and user-friendly, ensuring a pleasant browsing experience for visitors.
2. Implementing smooth navigation functionality that enables seamless transitions between different sections of the portfolio, enhancing usability.
3. Incorporating a contact form with validation mechanisms and error notifications to ensure accurate and reliable communication with potential clients or employers.
4. Integrating links to the developer's resume and social media profiles, allowing easy access to additional information and fostering connectivity.

## Assigned User Story:
```
AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

## Acceptance Criteria:
```
GIVEN a single-page application portfolio for a web developer
WHEN I load the portfolio
THEN I am presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer
WHEN I view the header
THEN I am presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio
WHEN I view the navigation titles
THEN I am presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted
WHEN I click on a navigation title
THEN I am presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted
WHEN I load the portfolio the first time
THEN the About Me title and section are selected by default
WHEN I am presented with the About Me section
THEN I see a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them
WHEN I am presented with the Portfolio section
THEN I see titled images of six of the developer’s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repositories
WHEN I am presented with the Contact section
THEN I see a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message
WHEN I move my cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text
THEN I receive a notification that this field is required
WHEN I enter text into the email address field
THEN I receive a notification if I have entered an invalid email address
WHEN I am presented with the Resume section
THEN I see a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer’s proficiencies
WHEN I view the footer
THEN I am presented with text or icon links to the developer’s GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, and their profile on a third platform (Stack Overflow, Twitter)
```

## What I Learned:
1. Gain knowledge and experience in constructing a single-page application using React. This involves understanding the fundamentals of React and utilizing its components, state management, and lifecycle methods to create an interactive and efficient user interface.
2. Learn how to implement smooth navigation within the single-page application using React Router. This involves setting up routes and configuring navigation links to enable seamless transitions between different sections or pages of the application.
3. Develop skills in designing a responsive and visually appealing interface. This includes using CSS and styling frameworks to create layouts that adapt well to different screen sizes and devices, ensuring a user-friendly experience across various platforms.
4. Acquire the ability to integrate form validation and error handling in React applications. This involves utilizing form validation libraries or building custom validation logic to validate user inputs, provide appropriate feedback or error messages, and handle any errors that may occur during form submission.

### Continued Development:
1. Expand the portfolio by adding a dedicated blog section where the developer can share their thoughts, experiences, and insights related to web development or technology. This can provide additional value to visitors and showcase the developer's expertise and knowledge in the field.
2. Enhance the user experience by implementing a search functionality within the portfolio section. This allows users to quickly find specific work samples based on keywords or filters, making it easier for them to navigate through the developer's projects and find relevant examples.
3. Strengthen credibility and showcase the developer's reputation by incorporating testimonials from previous clients or employers. Testimonials can help build trust and provide social proof of the developer's skills and professionalism.
4. Improve accessibility and user experience by integrating a dark mode toggle. This allows users to switch between light and dark themes, catering to their preferences and potentially reducing eye strain in low-light environments. Implementing accessibility features demonstrates a commitment to inclusivity and enhances the overall usability of the application.
